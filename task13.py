#  Create a function that takes a positive integer and returns the next bigger number that can be formed by rearranging its digits.

# Whole idea of this program is that if n=549652 we have to find the the spot where number to right is larger than
# number to left which is there =   5<49>652,   then we have to find minimally larger number to the right from 4.
#                    5 4 <96 <5> 2>  and put swap their order  55<9642> now we sort our digits in
#                   triangular bracket, and that's how you find next bigger number
