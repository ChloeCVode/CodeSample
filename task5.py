#  Johnny is a farmer and he annually holds a beet farmers convention "Drop the beet".
#  Every year he takes photos of farmers handshaking. Johnny knows that no two farmers handshake more than once.
#  He also knows that some of the possible handshake combinations may not happen.
#  However, Johnny would like to know the minimal amount of people that participated this year just by counting all the handshakes.
#  Help Johnny by writing a function, that takes the amount of handshakes and returns the minimal amount of people
#  needed to perform these handshakes (a pair of farmers handshake only once).
