#  You live in the city of Cartesia where all roads are laid out in a perfect grid. You arrived ten minutes too early to an appointment,
#  so you decided to take the opportunity to go for a short walk.
#  The city provides its citizens with a Walk Generating App on their phones
#  -- everytime you press the button it sends you an array of one-letter strings representing directions to walk
#  (eg. ['n', 's', 'w', 'e']). You always walk only a single block for each letter (direction)
#  and you know it takes you one minute to traverse one city block, so create a function that will return true
#  if the walk the app gives you will take you exactly ten minutes (you don't want to be early or late!) and will,
#  of course, return you to your starting point. Return false otherwise.
