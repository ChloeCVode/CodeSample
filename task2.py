#   Your task is to implement an algorithm that is able to execute the Twenty-One Card Trick. To simplify things,
#   the cards will be changed to the set of integers between 1 and 21(inclusive).
#   The function will be passed as argument a member of the audience that has selected a certain card and has a method
#   get_input that receives a list of 3 lists as arguments and returns the index of the column containing the selected card.
