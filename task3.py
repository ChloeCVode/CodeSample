#  In a small town the population is p0 = 1000 at the beginning of a year.
#  The population regularly increases by 2 percent per year and moreover 50 new inhabitants per year come to live in the town.
#  How many years does the town need to see its population greater or equal to p = 1200 inhabitants?

#  More generally given parameters:
# p0, percent, aug (inhabitants coming or leaving each year), p (population to equal or surpass)
# the function nb_year should return n number of entire years needed to get a population greater or equal to p.
# aug is an integer, percent a positive or null floating number, p0 and p are positive integers (> 0)

#Don't forget to convert the percent parameter as a percentage in the body of your function: if the parameter percent
# is 2 you have to convert it to 0.02.
